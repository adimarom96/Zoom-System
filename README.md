# Zoom-System
In-class project, implementing a zoom system which includes 3 types of different student, where each type of student allows to execute a different kind of functionality.
The system is simulated to the zoom app, each room includes students and can split into another room while the student is allocated to those rooms.
In this project, I practice c++ principles, memory allocation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
